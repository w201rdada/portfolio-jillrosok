## The current state of representation and how it affects understandings of news
The way we represent specific identities fundamentally shapes readers’ interpretation of the news and world events. In the past ten years there has been increasing discussion around how underrepresentation affects people’s perceptions of what they and others are capable of. 

There are three primary ways people are mentioned in stories: people who are the center of the story, people who help ground the story, such as a witness, and people who are experts. It is crucial when analyzing the frequency with which different identities are represented to separate sources into those groups, because the aggregate might mask the nuances of what’s actually happening. For instance, it may be possible that experts are rarely people of color.

Additionally, it is crucial to understand the themes and sentiments correlated with specific groups. Are women featured as often as men, but mostly as wives and housemakers? Are black people represented proportionally to other races, but typically as people suspected of crimes? By understanding not only the frequency which certain groups are mentioned, but also the context, journalists will be better able to see where they can improve and track progress. 

Despite these vocal proponents of diversity in media change has been slow, in large part because the writers and producers of major companies are primarily of demographics that are well represented in the media. As a result, they do not see the social need or the business value of changing their work. By illustrating the current state of representation through data, decision makers will gain a better awareness of why underrepresentation is a problem and the changes they can make to improve media and journalism. 
## A deeper look into pre-Existing analyses on representation and how data science can bolster this research
Many people have an intuitive sense that certain identities are overrepresented in the media, but it is much harder to to pinpoint how these identities are portrayed in terms of tone and mood.  

In order to ensure buy-in from the newsroom, this project would be most effective as a partnership between a media company and a local university -- perhaps Columbia, which is known for it's journalism and computer science programs, and The New York Times. The partnership with a university separate from the media company is crucial because it would be impossible to maximize the potential impact of this kind of project if the first company that used the product expected exclusive access. Once the initial research and development phase ends, then this analysis and any tools that come out of it should be open source. 

One of the benefits about partnering with a newsroom is that many newsrooms already do some article tagging that can be used as a starting point for this analysis. 

The first step of this project will be to identify mentions of people in each article and use something like word2vec to determine whether a person mentioned is a subject, witness or expert. Gender is the easiest dimension of diversity because many names are associated with a gender. The remainder of the names could be hand-tagged, scraped from social media profiles or for public figures, one could leverage their wikipedia pages to determine gender as well as other dimensions of identity. These names with associated dimensions of identity should be open sourced along with the rest of the project in order to limit manual work in the future and bring to light mistaken characterizations. Developing a method of automating this process of identifying people and their identities will likely be the most work-intensive portion of the project. 

Once this identification process is completed the next step is to analyze which kinds of articles mention

## Sentiment analysis will provide additional transparency for readers and journalists
A more explicit characterization of how marginalized identities are represented in the media will help journalists to share a wider range of perspectives as well as provide readers with a more critical lens through which to interpret news. 

There will be pushback from both the business side and the journalism side from this kind of analysis. The business behind media is struggling and must constantly find a balance between “the right thing to do” and what will ultimately bring in revenue for the company. 

Journalists often believe they are already writing objective pieces and are only “reporting on what’s newsworthy”. They may be concerned that observing the coverage of marginalized groups may lead to coverage being based on fulfilling diversity quotas rather than the most important news. The goal of this tool is not to create arbitrary goals for coverage, but instead to provide journalists and editors with more detailed information on patterns of coverage rather than as a decider for whether an individual article is published. It will be crucial to have in depth conversations with those involved with the media industry in order to create lasting change.

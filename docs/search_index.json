Representing Marginalized People in Media My first project seeks to identify the state of representation in the media. Mentions of women and people of color are programatically identified in media and then these articles are analyzed to determine the context and tone of these mentions. This can be used as a benchmarking tool for journalists and their editors to identify benchmarks and where to improve. Computer Generated Art to Accompany Poetry My second project uses natural langauge processing to identify themes in poems and subsequently create visual art from those themes.

In the past ten years there has been increasing discussion around how underrepresentation affects people’s perceptions of what they and others are capable of (Milloy 2017). There are three primary ways people are mentioned in stories: people who are the center of the story, people who help ground the story, such as a witness, and people who are experts. It is crucial when analyzing the frequency with which different identities are represented to separate sources into those groups, because the aggregate might mask the nuances of what’s actually happening. For instance, it may be possible that experts are rarely people of color. Additionally, it is crucial to understand the themes and sentiments correlated with specific groups. Are women featured as often as men, but mostly as wives and housemakers? Are black people represented proportionally to other races, but typically as people suspected of crimes? By understanding not only the frequency which certain groups are mentioned, but also the context, journalists will be better able to see where they can improve and track progress (“Visible Minorities in News Media MediaSmarts” 2018). Despite vocal proponents of diversity in media change has been slow, in part because the writers and producers of major companies are primarily of demographics that are well represented in the media (Abbady 2018). As a result, they do not see the social need or the business value of changing their work. By illustrating the current state of representation through data, decision makers will gain a better awareness of why underrepresentation is a problem and the changes they can make to improve media and journalism. 1.2 A deeper look into how data science can bolster our understanding of representation in the news media Many people have an intuitive sense that certain identities are overrepresented in the media, but it is much harder to to pinpoint how these identities are portrayed in terms of tone and mood. In order to ensure buy-in from the newsroom, this project would be most effective as a partnership between a media company and a local university – perhaps Columbia, which is known for its journalism and computer science programs, and The New York Times. The partnership with a university separate from the media company is crucial because it would be impossible to maximize the potential impact of this kind of project if the first company that used the product expected exclusive access. Once the initial research and development phase ends, then this analysis and any tools that come out of it should be open source and available to any newsroom that wants to see how they are performing in terms of representation. One of the benefits about partnering with a newsroom is that many newsrooms already do some article tagging that can be used as a starting point for this analysis. The first step of this project will be to identify mentions of people in each article and use a library like word2vec to determine whether a person mentioned is a subject, witness or expert. Gender is the easiest dimension of diversity because many names are associated with a gender. The remainder of the names could be hand-tagged, scraped from social media profiles or for public figures, one could leverage their wikipedia pages to determine gender as well as other dimensions of identity. These names with associated dimensions of identity should be open sourced along with the rest of the project in order to limit manual work in the future and bring to light mistaken characterizations. Developing a method of automating this process of identifying people and their identities will likely be the most work-intensive portion of the project. Once this identification process is completed the next step is to analyze which kinds of articles mention various demographics of people. The aforementioned article tags might come in handy here as a starting point to identify themes or subject matter of the article. Additionally, it is important to do some sentiment analysis. At a bare minimum, I suggest determining whether the mention is negative or positive. Ideally, the sentiment analysis will be more complex and get into ideas like the tone of the article is positive, but the woman is being praised as “motherly” or a “caretaker” and therefore this article does not push beyond stereotypes. The sentiment analysis is vitally important, because in order for this tool to be actionable, for instance, we need to be able to understand the nuance between an article about a black woman who is prosecuting a criminal and an article about a black woman being charged with a crime. The python library TextBlob would be a good place to start analyzing the sentiment of articles. The final product of this analysis is a tool that can be used by the newsroom (primarily editors and those on the masthead) to understand how certain demographics are currently being covered and places where the company could improve. What would be most useful to start would be to show the paper’s overall representation statistics and allow viewers to drill down into specific desks or periods of time. I imagine the type of high-level summary that would be useful could contain a breakdown showing frequency of representation for various identities and positive, stereotypical positive (women are caretakers or asians are smart), stereotypical negative (people of color are lazy or criminals) and negative. These breakdowns of what is stereotypical or not should be handled by the machine learning steps described earlier, but should have some transparency into what categories or article characteristics lead something to be categorized as stereotypical in order to empower editors to take action with this information. While individual journalists could access the details of each individual article, the main purpose of them having access would be in order to enable journalists to manually input demographic info that was not available through the initial categorization process. If a journalist (or their editor) is particularly concerned about representation in their coverage, they could look at the articles they have published over time and attempt to expand the subjects they cover. It is vitally important that everyone who is a part of the newsroom or the business side has access to this information. By enabling transparency, the newsroom will be under more pressure to act quickly, which is both the company’s moral and financial imperative. 1.3 Sentiment analysis will provide additional transparency for readers and journalists A more explicit characterization of how marginalized identities are represented in the media will help journalists to share a wider range of perspectives as well as provide readers with a more critical lens through which to interpret news. Many newsrooms recognize that they have a problem, but don’t feel they have access to the solutions they need in the short term. A tool like this is a small step to improving representation in news by increasing transparency of what is being published. There will be pushback from both the business side and the journalism side from this kind of analysis. The business behind media is struggling and must constantly find a balance between “the right thing to do” and what will ultimately bring in revenue for the company. That said, it is fairly well-documented that diversity often leads to better financial outcomes and in the case of the news media, it is vitally important to expand subscribers beyond the market of older white people. By representing diverse identities more extensively and respectfully, readers of those backgrounds will be more interested in consuming that media (Hunt et al. 2018). Journalists often believe they are already writing objective pieces and are only “reporting on what’s newsworthy”. They may be concerned that observing the coverage of marginalized groups may lead to coverage being based on fulfilling diversity quotas rather than the most important news. The goal of this tool is not to create arbitrary goals for coverage, but instead to provide journalists and editors with more detailed information on patterns of coverage rather than as a decider for whether an individual article is published. This will come easier for some desks than others. Style and culture can easily accommodate a variety of different identities. Since politics in the US trends very white and male, it is more difficult to have even representation, but it is still worth tracking progress and considering where improvements can be made. It will be crucial to have in depth conversations with those involved with the media industry in order to create lasting change. Bibliography "],
["computer-generated-art-resembles-poetry.html", "2 Generating Visual Art to Accompany Poetry 2.1 Are computers capable of creating art? 2.2 How computers generate art 2.3 What are the potential values and risks of this project?", " 2 Generating Visual Art to Accompany Poetry Keywords art, poetry, computer generated art, computer vision, nlp 2.1 Are computers capable of creating art? In order to answer whether computers can create art, we must first contemplate the purpose or definition of art. There are many ways people have defined art over time, but Merriam-Webster gets it right when it explains that art is “the conscious use of skill and creative imagination especially in the production of aesthetic objects” (“Definition of ART” 2018). For some, this might ring alarm bells. How could computer generated art be considered “conscious”? Given that any computer program originates from a human or humans who developed it, the artistic process itself is created by its human creator(s). Therefore, even though a machine is implementing the program, the art that emerges is inherently a computer-generated reflection of the artist who wrote the program whether they wish to have an influence or not. This project seeks to create computer generated visual art to be paired with written poetry. Next comes the question of why such a project is worthy of creating and who might use and pay for the development of computer generated art. In terms of value, it is vitally important to acknowledge from the beginning that art has intrinsic value. Unfortunately, intrinsic value does not (typically) pay the bills. What Do You Believe A Poem Shd Do? Visual art to accompany poetry has a variety of practical applications. It could assist non-expert readers in relating, understanding and articulating the feelings behind a piece of poetry. It could surface how similes and metaphors align with the poem’s true subject. It could provide a means to display poetry in a museum paired with its generated art. It could be used in classrooms for students who are not yet comfortable with interpreting poetry. This project would almost certainly need to be funded by some kind of grant. Universities like NYU and Carnegie Mellon seem like obvious choices given that both universities have produced work in the intersection of media and technology. 2.2 How computers generate art This project will be building off Gene Kogan’s work on computer generated art as well as Allison Parrish’s computer generated poetry. Kogan’s work centers on creating “software for creativity and self-expression” and Parrish’s work “uses computers to find unexpected things about language beyond the bounds of human semantic constraints” (Kogan 2018) (Fernandez 2017). By its nature, this project will have naive beginnings; potentially first determining the color palate of a poem using the results of an xkcd color survey to determine the relation between specific colors defined using hexidecimal values and the words in a poem using word vectors (Randallpmunroe 2010). This idea is based on Allison Parrish’s work researching poetry (Parrish 2015). These naive beginnings can then be built upon to intersect with something like “random art” which takes a word and generates a corresponding picture using a mathematical formual that is not intended to align with the meaning of the words (Bauer 2018). In order to build upon the “random art”, we will use NLP and sentiment analysis to identify key themes as well as the overall tone of the poem. Basic sentiment analysis has historically lacked nuance and is particularly fraught when analyzing unconventional or ironic use of language. These shortcomings could pose a significant challenge to analyzing poetry since poetry is often experimental and on the vanguard of language use. As a result, it is vital that we do not use an out of the box sentiment analysis library and instead build upon current solutions until we reach our desired level of nuance. To make matters even more complicated, we must then associate these themes and emotions from poems to visual art, which is not always a simple task. Perhaps we could crowd source reactions online of emotions and concepts readers associate with randomly generated art. Once we have sufficient data on which image features to produce for a wide range of concepts, we can match poem concepts with art concepts to generate an associated image. As a starting point, this project could consist of a webapp that takes a user inputted poem and outputs an image which can subsequently be rated by the user whether it matches with their interpretation of the tone of poem or not. The algorithm could subsequently integrate these ratings into its evaluation of what kind of art to generate. It is vitally important to the success of such a project that there is a validation step by users in order to let the algorithm know when it’s gone way off the mark. If this process doesn’t work another option might be to associate human-created pieces of art that might be good pairs for poems. Again I think crowd sourcing the expertise of the internet might be a good strategy here. 2.3 What are the potential values and risks of this project? Ultimately, the value of an artistic endeavor is the process and the output and it is not crucial that the art provide value outside of itself. The purpose of creating art is to create art. The purpose of consuming art is to consume art. That said, I think matching poetry to visual art could enable non-experts to relate more with poetry that may have previously seemed too abstract. There are a few potential pitfalls in a project of this nature. When creating art that is added onto what was another artist’s original creation it is fundamental to determine whether an artist would be comfortable with such a modification. Additionally, we must consider if such a modification would change the meaning of a poem and determine to what extent this is problematic. It is the moral and the legal obligation of the creators of this project to ensure that we are not modifying or replicating artistic work without consent. As a starting point, it might make sense to pair with several poets who are familiar with the project and want their work to be incorporated. These poets could also serve as a manual validation method for the algorithm in the early stages of development. If done right, this project benefits both consenting poets and those who wish to read their work. One can imagine potential extensions of this project to long form texts. Given the current implementation, I don’t think our program would output much of use because there would be so many contradicting themes (although maybe it would surprise us!). That said, computer generated art could be extremely useful for children’s books and short chapter books for those beginning to read where there might be illustrations on most pages. Bibliography "],
